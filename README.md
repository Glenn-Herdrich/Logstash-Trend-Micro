Config file for Trend Micro: Control Manager, Deep Security, Deep Discovery Inspector

Im a bit new to elastic and spend too much time trying to figure out how to configure these so figured I would share. FYI this thing still needs work but it will hopefully point you in the right direction. Feel free to let me know if you found a better way!

Control Manager: CEF
Deep Security: LEEF
Deep Discovery Inspector: LEEF
